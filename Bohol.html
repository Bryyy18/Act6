    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;"><span style="color: lightgreen;">Bohol</span> is one of the Philippines' most popular and tourist-friendly locations. Because of its <br>magnificent and unique features, including the Chocolate Hills, this island province in the Central <br>Visayas area attracts people from all over the world. The province has a long and illustrious history, with churches going back to the time of Spanish <br>colonialism. It has a variety of adrenaline-pumping activities for adventurers. But it is Panglao Island's <br>beautiful sand beaches, world-class dive spots, and generally laid-back provincial culture that give Bohol its distinct appeal.</p>

    <h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 30px; padding-top: 60px; color: lightgreen">Chocolate Hills</h1>
    <img src="./images/d.jpg" alt="pic3" width="800px" height="500px">
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">The Chocolate Hills is declared the Philippines' 3rd National Geological Monument and is dubbed as an Eight <br>Wonder of the World. It won't take long before you realize why it's one of the must-visit destinations in the country once you see its <br>scenic characteristics firsthand. These iconic hills are even featured in the 200 Philippine Peso bill. You can conveniently explore them via a Bohol Chocolate Hills tour</p>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">The majestic Chocolate Hills is one of the Philippines' most popular tourist attractions and is the <br>top destination for Bohol tours aside from island hopping in the Philippines. It got its name from <br>its strange yet unique formation and rich vegetation that turns into chocolate brown during the dry months, hence, the name. </p>

    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 20px;">The word "hinagdanan" means laddered in Cebuano. This now-famous Bohol tourist destination is <br>said been accidentally discovered by a farmer who built a ladder to access the cave, thus the name.</p>
